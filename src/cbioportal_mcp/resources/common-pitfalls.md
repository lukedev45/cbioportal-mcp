# Common Query Pitfalls Guide

## Overview
This guide highlights frequent mistakes when analyzing cBioPortal data and provides solutions to avoid them.

## Critical Pitfalls

### 1. 🚨 CRITICAL MUTATION FREQUENCY ERRORS

#### ❌ WRONG: Using study-wide totals for gene frequencies
```sql
-- INCORRECT - This gives wrong frequencies!
SELECT
    hugo_gene_symbol,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as altered_samples,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id)
     FROM genomic_event_derived
     WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id') as total_samples
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation' AND cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id'
GROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol;
```
**Problem**: Different genes have different profiling coverage - you can't use study-wide totals!

#### ❌ WRONG: Not using gene-specific profiling denominators
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Missing gene-specific denominators
SELECT
    hugo_gene_symbol,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as altered_samples
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation'
GROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol;
-- Missing: WHERE ARE THE DENOMINATORS FOR EACH GENE?
```

#### ❌ WRONG: Skipping individual gene profiling queries
**Problem**: Failing to run separate profiling queries for EACH gene in results.
**Each gene has different coverage**: TP53 might be profiled in 25,040 samples, MUC16 in 23,000, etc.

#### ✅ CORRECT: Complete gene-specific workflow
```sql
-- STEP 1: Get altered counts per gene
SELECT
    hugo_gene_symbol,
    entrez_gene_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN off_panel = 0 THEN sample_unique_id END) AS numberOfAlteredSamplesOnPanel,
    COUNT(*) AS totalMutationEvents
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation' AND mutation_status != 'UNCALLED'
GROUP BY entrez_gene_id, hugo_gene_symbol
ORDER BY numberOfAlteredSamplesOnPanel DESC;

-- STEP 2: FOR EACH GENE, run this profiling query:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT stgp.sample_unique_id) AS numberOfProfiledSamples
FROM sample_to_gene_panel_derived stgp
JOIN gene_panel gp ON stgp.gene_panel_id = gp.stable_id
JOIN gene_panel_list gpl ON gp.internal_id = gpl.internal_id
JOIN gene g ON gpl.gene_id = g.entrez_gene_id
WHERE stgp.alteration_type = 'MUTATION_EXTENDED'
  AND g.hugo_gene_symbol = 'TP53'  -- Replace with each gene from Step 1
  AND stgp.cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id';

-- STEP 3: Calculate frequency = numberOfAlteredSamplesOnPanel / numberOfProfiledSamples * 100
```

#### 🚨 WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS VIOLATIONS:
- **Missing denominator columns**: Must show gene-specific profiled samples per row
- **Wrong table format**: Should be | Gene | # Mutations | # Samples | Profiled Samples | Sample % |
- **Not replacing gene symbols**: Must replace 'TP53' with actual gene for each query
- **Using study totals**: Never use genomic_event_derived for total sample counts

### 2. 🚨 OFF-PANEL MUTATION INCLUSION

#### ❌ Wrong: Including off-panel mutations
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Includes mutations outside gene panels
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM genomic_event_derived WHERE variant_type = 'mutation';
```

#### ✅ Correct: Filter out off-panel mutations
```sql
-- CORRECT - Only on-panel mutations
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation' AND off_panel = 0;
```

### 3. 🚨 MUTATION STATUS FILTERING ERRORS

#### ❌ WRONG: Filtering mutation_status = 'SOMATIC'
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Too restrictive filtering
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation' AND mutation_status = 'SOMATIC';
```
**Problem**: This excludes valid mutations with status 'UNKNOWN' and other non-SOMATIC statuses!

#### ❌ WRONG: Including uncalled mutations
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Includes uncalled/uncertain mutations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM genomic_event_derived WHERE variant_type = 'mutation';
```

#### ✅ CORRECT: Exclude UNCALLED only, include ALL other statuses
```sql
-- CORRECT - Include SOMATIC, UNKNOWN, etc. but exclude UNCALLED
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation' AND mutation_status != 'UNCALLED';
```
**Key**: Include ALL statuses ('SOMATIC', 'UNKNOWN', etc.) except 'UNCALLED'

### 4. 🚨 MISSING STUDY FILTERS

#### ❌ Wrong: Querying across all studies
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Results mix different studies/platforms
SELECT hugo_gene_symbol, COUNT(*) as mutations
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation'
GROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol;
```

#### ✅ Correct: Always filter by study
```sql
-- CORRECT - Study-specific analysis
SELECT hugo_gene_symbol, COUNT(*) as mutations
FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE variant_type = 'mutation' AND cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id'
GROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol;
```

### 5. 🚨 PATIENT VS SAMPLE CONFUSION

#### ❌ Wrong: Mixing patient and sample counts
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Mixing levels of aggregation
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as patients,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as samples,
    -- This calculation is meaningless!
    (COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id)) as ratio
FROM clinical_data_derived;
```

#### ✅ Correct: Keep aggregation levels separate
```sql
-- CORRECT - Separate patient and sample analysis
SELECT
    'Patient Level' as analysis_level,
    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_unique_id) as count
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Sample Level' as analysis_level,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as count
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id';
```

### 5b. 🚨 SAMPLE TYPE FILTERING ERRORS

#### ❌ WRONG: Using `sample.sample_type` column instead of clinical attribute
```sql
-- INCORRECT - sample.sample_type is NOT the primary/metastatic distinction!
SELECT COUNT(*) as primary_samples
FROM sample s
JOIN patient p ON s.patient_id = p.internal_id
WHERE p.cancer_study_id = 791
  AND s.sample_type = 'Primary';  -- WRONG COLUMN!
-- Returns 0 because sample_type contains "Primary Solid Tumor" for ALL samples
```
**Problem**: The `sample.sample_type` column contains general classifications like "Primary Solid Tumor" (for all tumor samples). It does NOT distinguish between primary vs metastatic samples!

#### ❌ WRONG: Assuming all samples are "Primary"
```sql
-- INCORRECT - This counts ALL samples, not just primary samples!
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as primary_samples
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024';
-- Returns 25,040 (total samples), not 15,928 (primary samples)
```
**Problem**: Studies often have multiple sample types (Primary, Metastasis, Recurrence, etc.). Never assume all samples are primary!

#### ✅ CORRECT: Use clinical_data_derived with SAMPLE_TYPE attribute
```sql
-- CORRECT - Filter using SAMPLE_TYPE attribute in clinical_data_derived
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as primary_samples
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'msk_chord_2024'
  AND attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'
  AND attribute_value = 'Primary';
-- Returns 15,928 (actual primary samples)
```

#### ✅ CORRECT: First check sample type distribution
```sql
-- ALWAYS check what sample types exist in a study first
SELECT
    attribute_value as sample_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample_unique_id) as sample_count
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id'
  AND attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'
GROUP BY attribute_value
ORDER BY sample_count DESC;
```

**Critical Distinction:**
| Column/Attribute | Location | Contains | Use For |
|------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| `sample.sample_type` | sample table | General class (e.g., "Primary Solid Tumor") | NOT for primary/metastatic queries |
| `SAMPLE_TYPE` attribute | clinical_data_derived | Specific type (Primary, Metastasis, etc.) | Primary vs metastatic filtering |

**Common SAMPLE_TYPE Values (clinical_data_derived):**
| Sample Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Primary` | Primary tumor samples |
| `Metastasis` | Metastatic tumor samples |
| `Local Recurrence` | Locally recurrent tumors |
| `Unknown` | Sample type not specified |

**Key Rule**: When asked about "primary samples", "metastatic samples", etc., ALWAYS use `clinical_data_derived` with `attribute_name = 'SAMPLE_TYPE'`. NEVER use the `sample.sample_type` column!

## Data Type Pitfalls

### 6. 🚨 STRING VS NUMERIC COMPARISONS

#### ❌ Wrong: Treating numbers as strings
```sql
-- INCORRECT - String comparison gives wrong results
SELECT * FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE attribute_name = 'AGE' AND attribute_value > '50';  -- String comparison!
```

#### ✅ Correct: Cast to appropriate type
```sql
-- CORRECT - Numeric comparison
SELECT * FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE attribute_name = 'AGE' AND CAST(attribute_value AS Float64) > 50;
```

### 7. 🚨 NULL VALUE HANDLING

#### ❌ Wrong: Ignoring NULL values
```sql
-- INCORRECT - NULLs are ignored in calculations
SELECT AVG(CAST(attribute_value AS Float64)) as avg_age
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE attribute_name = 'AGE';
```

#### ✅ Correct: Explicit NULL handling
```sql
-- CORRECT - Handle NULLs explicitly
SELECT
    AVG(CAST(attribute_value AS Float64)) as avg_age,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN attribute_value IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as non_null_records
FROM clinical_data_derived
WHERE attribute_name = 'AGE';
```

## Join Pitfalls

### 8. 🚨 INCORRECT JOINS

#### ❌ Wrong: Joining on wrong keys
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Wrong join relationship
SELECT *
FROM patient p
JOIN sample s ON p.cancer_study_id = s.internal_id;  -- Wrong keys!
```

#### ✅ Correct: Use proper join keys
```sql
-- CORRECT - Proper foreign key relationship
SELECT *
FROM patient p
JOIN sample s ON p.internal_id = s.patient_id;
```

### 9. 🚨 CARTESIAN PRODUCTS

#### ❌ Wrong: Missing join conditions
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Creates cartesian product
SELECT *
FROM genomic_event_derived g, clinical_data_derived c
WHERE g.cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id'
  AND c.cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id';
```

#### ✅ Correct: Proper join condition
```sql
-- CORRECT - Join on sample ID
SELECT *
FROM genomic_event_derived g
JOIN clinical_data_derived c ON g.sample_unique_id = c.sample_unique_id
WHERE g.cancer_study_identifier = 'your_study_id';
```

## Performance Pitfalls

### 10. 🚨 INEFFICIENT QUERIES

#### ❌ Wrong: Multiple subqueries
```sql
-- INCORRECT - Inefficient repeated subqueries
SELECT
    hugo_gene_symbol,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM genomic_event_derived WHERE hugo_gene_symbol = g.hugo_gene_symbol) as total
FROM genomic_event_derived g;
```

#### ✅ Correct: Use aggregation
```sql
-- CORRECT - Single aggregation query
SELECT
    hugo_gene_symbol,
    COUNT(*) as total
FROM genomic_event_derived
GROUP BY hugo_gene_symbol;
```

## CNA and Column Name Pitfalls

### 11. 🚨 CNA VALUES ARE NUMERIC, NOT STRINGS

#### ❌ Wrong: Using string values for CNA
```sql
-- INCORRECT - cna_alteration is numeric!
SELECT * FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE cna_alteration = 'AMP';
```

#### ✅ Correct: Use numeric values
```sql
-- CORRECT - Use numeric codes
SELECT * FROM genomic_event_derived
WHERE cna_alteration = 2;   -- 2 = Amplification
-- OR
WHERE cna_alteration = -2;  -- -2 = Homozygous Deletion
```

### 12. 🚨 WRONG COLUMN NAMES

#### ❌ Wrong: Using non-existent column names
```sql
-- INCORRECT - 'protein_change' doesn't exist
SELECT protein_change FROM genomic_event_derived;
```

#### ✅ Correct: Use actual column names
```sql
-- CORRECT - Use 'mutation_variant' for protein changes
SELECT mutation_variant FROM genomic_event_derived;
```

**Key column reference:**
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| `protein_change` | `mutation_variant` |
| `amino_acid_change` | `mutation_variant` |

## ClickHouse-Specific Pitfalls

### 13. 🚨 CTE COLUMN REFERENCE ISSUES

ClickHouse has limitations with CTEs - you can't always reference CTE column aliases in outer expressions.

#### ❌ Wrong: Referencing CTE aliases in calculations
```sql
-- MAY FAIL - CTE alias reference issues
WITH stats AS (
    SELECT patient_id, MAX(CASE WHEN gene='TP53' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as tp53
    FROM mutations GROUP BY patient_id
)
SELECT SUM(tp53) FROM stats;  -- 'tp53' may not be recognized
```

#### ✅ Correct: Use subquery instead
```sql
-- CORRECT - Use subquery for complex aggregations
SELECT SUM(tp53) FROM (
    SELECT patient_id, MAX(CASE WHEN gene='TP53' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as tp53
    FROM mutations GROUP BY patient_id
);
```

### 14. 🚨 FABRICATING OncoKB DRIVER ANNOTATIONS

#### ❌ WRONG: Claiming mutations are OncoKB drivers without data
The ClickHouse database does NOT contain OncoKB annotations. There are no `cbp_driver`, `oncokb_oncogenic`, or driver filter columns in `genomic_event_derived`.

Do NOT:
- Claim a mutation is or isn't an OncoKB driver
- Fabricate oncogenicity classifications (Oncogenic, Likely Oncogenic, etc.)
- Assume truncating mutations in tumor suppressors are drivers without OncoKB data

#### ✅ CORRECT: Be transparent about limitations
When asked about OncoKB driver/oncogenic mutations:
1. State clearly that the ClickHouse database does not contain OncoKB annotations
2. Suggest using the cBioPortal web interface with OQL `DRIVER` syntax (see mutation-frequency-guide)
3. Offer what IS possible via SQL: filter by mutation type, specific known hotspot variants, or variant classification

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always use gene-specific denominators** for mutation frequencies
2. **Filter out off-panel mutations** with `off_panel = 0`
3. **Exclude uncalled mutations** with `mutation_status != 'UNCALLED'`
4. **Always specify study identifier** for consistent results
5. **Keep patient vs sample aggregation separate**
6. **Filter by SAMPLE_TYPE** when asked about specific sample types (primary, metastatic, etc.)
7. **Cast clinical values to appropriate data types**
8. **Handle NULL values explicitly**
9. **Use proper join keys and conditions**
10. **Avoid cartesian products**
11. **Use derived tables when possible** for better performance
12. **Use numeric values for CNA** (2=AMP, -2=HOMDEL)
13. **Use correct column names** (`mutation_variant` not `protein_change`)
14. **Use subqueries instead of CTEs** for complex aggregations in ClickHouse
15. **Never fabricate OncoKB annotations** — the database has no driver/oncogenic columns

## Validation Checklist

Before trusting your results, ask:
- [ ] Did I filter by specific study?
- [ ] Did I exclude off-panel and uncalled mutations?
- [ ] Are my denominators gene-specific (not study-wide)?
- [ ] Am I comparing the right data types?
- [ ] Did I handle NULL values appropriately?
- [ ] Do my join conditions make biological sense?
- [ ] Are my sample counts reasonable for the study?
- [ ] Did I use numeric values for CNA alterations (not strings)?
- [ ] Am I using the correct column names (mutation_variant, not protein_change)?
- [ ] When asked about specific sample types (primary, metastatic, etc.), did I filter by SAMPLE_TYPE?
- [ ] Am I claiming OncoKB driver/oncogenic status? If so, STOP — that data is not in the database.
